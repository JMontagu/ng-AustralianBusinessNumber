## angular-grunt-seed â€” the seed for AngularJS apps with Grunt support (jshint, Karma, Watch, connect etc)

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these projects. This comes with default Grunt build for lint, Karma, Watch etc.


## How to use angular-grunt-seed

Clone the angular-grunt-seed repository and start hacking...


### Running the app during development

> grunt

This will use concurrent task runner to do following tasks in a watch mode:

1) Watch for any JS (src and test files) changes and run jsHint

2) Watch for any JS (src and test files) changes and run Karma

3) Start the Node server at "9000"
